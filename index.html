            <p ><a target="_blank" href="https://www.snhu.edu/tuition-and-financial-aid/student-loans"> link to snhu student loans info</a> SNHU is a college based in New Hampshire. You can enter with upto 90 credits and then get the degree in a year, but the credits must have been earned from an accredited school and for a subject relating to IT. They also must be sent directly from the school to the college. Alternatively the college wil accept them as long as they are still sealed in the original envelope they were sent in. To find out exactlt which credits will count you must first applyand then an admission councilor will help you.</p>
            
            <h3 id="purdue">Purdue University</h3>
            <p>I am not yet sure what the admission program consists of.
The program takes a total of 4 years. 180 credits earns you a degree. The program is split into groups of ten weeks. In each ten week period there are 2 classes. There is a break of 1 week between every ten. Each completed class earns you either 5 or 6 credits. That is a total of 10-12 creditsevery ten weeks. that comes out to araound 50 credits a year. Upto 75% of previously earned credits may be transfered.  To find out exactlt which credits will count you must first applyand then an admission councilor will help you. More information on exactly which credits I can tranfer I have yet to receive. Tuition goes by the credits and it is 370$ per credit hour. The workload is as following, every wed. they give you a certain amount of work to do, which must be sent in by the next tuesday at 11:59pm. One a week there is a live seminar, via skype (or the likes), wich must be attended.
